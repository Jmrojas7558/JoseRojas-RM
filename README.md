Research project on construction workers’ views on what causes project slowdowns in Southwest Florida. Includes surveys, data analysis, and recommendations to improve scheduling, communication, and workflow in production homebuilding.

## Construction Workers' Perspectives on Project Slowdowns in Southwest Florida

### Overview

This project investigates the causes of construction project delays from the viewpoint of workers in Southwest Florida. By collecting and analyzing survey data from various trades, the study aims to identify common issues affecting project timelines and propose practical solutions to improve efficiency.

#### Data

The research is based on anonymous surveys conducted with construction workers from multiple trades in the Fort Myers area. The data includes responses on factors contributing to project slowdowns, such as:

- Material delivery delays
- Labor shortages
- Weather-related disruptions
- Communication breakdowns

#### Usage 

 - Analyze Trends: Identify the most common causes of delays across different trades and roles.  
 - Compare Perspectives: Compare worker responses with those of supervisors or upper management to see where perceptions align or differ. 
 - Inform Decision-Making: Use the findings to suggest better scheduling, coordination, and workflow strategies on residential construction projects.


This project explores construction workers’ perspectives on what causes project slowdowns in Southwest Florida, focusing on production homebuilding. Using anonymous surveys from multiple trades in Fort Myers, the study collects data on common issues like material delays, labor shortages, weather interruptions, and communication breakdowns. The goal is to understand the worker’s point of view and identify patterns that affect project timelines.

The data can be analyzed to find trends across trades and roles, and it can also be compared with the perspectives of supervisors or upper management to spot differences in perception. Insights from this research can help construction managers improve scheduling, coordination, and overall workflow, leading to more efficient job sites, fewer delays, and better communication between workers and management.
